# Production-Ready MLOps Tutorial: From Data to Deployment

Welcome to this advanced, hands-on tutorial on building a production-ready MLOps stack. This interactive session will guide you through the entire lifecycle of a real-world machine learning system using industry-standard tools.

## Real-World Focus
Every step in this tutorial mirrors how top AI teams deploy decision intelligence systems. You will go from raw data to a fully monitored, production-grade API.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this interactive session, you will:
- ✅ Build a scalable ETL pipeline using **Prefect** & **Dask**.
- ✅ Run an AutoML workflow with **MLflow** tracking and model selection.
- ✅ Expose models as **FastAPI** microservices with circuit breakers.
- ✅ Implement monitoring, drift detection, and an automated retraining strategy.
- ✅ Walk away with a production-ready MLOps stack running locally.

## Tutorial Structure

This tutorial is divided into four labs, each presented as an interactive Jupyter Notebook:

- **Lab 1: Scalable ETL Pipelines:**
  - Build a robust ETL pipeline with Prefect for orchestration and Dask for parallel processing.

- **Lab 2: AutoML and Experiment Tracking:**
  - Use PyCaret for an AutoML workflow to find the best model.
  - Track all experiments and register the final model with MLflow.

- **Lab 3: Deploying Models as Microservices:**
  - Deploy the best model as a resilient FastAPI microservice, complete with a circuit breaker.

- **Lab 4: Monitoring, Drift Detection, and Retraining:**
  - Monitor the deployed model for drift using Evidently AI.
  - Develop a strategy for automated model retraining.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, you will need:
- Python 3.7+
- `pip` and `virtualenv` for managing dependencies.
- Docker (recommended, especially for running dependent services).

Each lab will contain a list of specific Python libraries to install.

Let's get started!
