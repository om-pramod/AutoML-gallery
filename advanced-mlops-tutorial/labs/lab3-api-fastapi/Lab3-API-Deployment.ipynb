    "### 2. Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is FastAPI?\n",
    "FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python. It's built on standards like OpenAPI and JSON Schema, which means you get automatic, interactive API documentation (like Swagger UI) for free.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is a Circuit Breaker?\n",
    "A circuit breaker is a design pattern used to detect failures and prevent a failing service from being constantly called. Imagine our API can't reach the MLflow server to load the model. Instead of timing out on every request, the circuit breaker will \"trip\" after a few failures. Once tripped, all subsequent requests will fail immediately for a set period, giving the failing service (MLflow) time to recover. This makes our API more resilient and responsive."

    "\n",
    "Our API is configured to load the model from the **\"Production\"** stage in the MLflow Model Registry. Before you can run the API, you must promote your model to this stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start the MLflow UI** if it's not already running (`mlflow ui` from the project root).\n",
    "2. **Go to the \"Models\" tab** and click on your `churn-classifier` model.\n",
    "3. **Select the latest version** (e.g., Version 1).\n",
    "4. In the top right, find the **\"Stage\"** dropdown.\n",
    "5. **Select \"Transition to Production\"** and add an optional comment. \n",
    "\n",
