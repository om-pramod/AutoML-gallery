# Hands-On Tutorial: Data Pipelines, MLOps, and Decision Intelligence

Welcome to this hands-on tutorial where you will learn the fundamentals of building robust data and machine learning systems. This tutorial will guide you through the entire lifecycle of a machine learning project, from raw data to a decision-making application.

## Tutorial Structure

This tutorial is divided into three labs:

- **Lab 1: Building Your First Data Pipeline**
  - Learn what data pipelines are and why they are essential.
  - Build a simple ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Python and `pandas`.

- **Lab 2: Introduction to MLOps with MLflow**
  - Get introduced to the core concepts of MLOps (Machine Learning Operations).
  - Use MLflow to track experiments, log metrics, and version your machine learning models.

- **Lab 3: From Predictions to Decisions with Decision Intelligence**
  - Understand the principles of Decision Intelligence.
  - Build an interactive web application with Streamlit and SHAP to not only get model predictions but also understand them.

## How to Use This Tutorial

1. **Clone the repository.**
2. **Start with Lab 1.** Navigate to the `labs/lab1-data-pipelines` directory and follow the instructions in the `README.md` file.
3. **Proceed to Lab 2.** After completing Lab 1, move to `labs/lab2-mlops` and follow the instructions there.
4. **Finish with Lab 3.** Complete the tutorial by going through `labs/lab3-decision-intelligence`.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.6+
- `pip` for installing packages.

Each lab's `README.md` will specify the Python libraries you need to install for that particular lab.

## Goal

By the end of this tutorial, you will have a practical understanding of:
- How to create a data pipeline to process and prepare data.
- How to manage the machine learning lifecycle using MLOps principles and tools.
- How to build applications that leverage machine learning for better decision-making.

We hope you find this tutorial engaging and informative. Let's get started!
